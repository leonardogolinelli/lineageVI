    Add annotations to an AnnData object from files.

    Parameters
    ----------
    adata
        Annotated data matrix.
    files
        Paths to text files with annotations. The function considers rows to be gene sets
        with name of a gene set in the first column followed by names of genes.
    min_genes
        Only include gene sets which have the total number of genes in adata
        greater than this value.
    max_genes
        Only include gene sets which have the total number of genes in adata
        less than this value.
    varm_key
        Store the binary array I of size n_vars x number of annotated terms in files
        in `adata.varm[varm_key]`. if I[i,j]=1 then the gene i is present in the annotation j.
    uns_key
        Sore gene sets' names in `adata.uns[uns_key]`.
    clean
        If 'True', removes the word before the first underscore for each term name (like 'REACTOME_')
        and cuts the name to the first thirty symbols.
    genes_use_upper
        if 'True', converts genes' names from files and adata to uppercase for comparison.
