Getting Started
---------------

:doc:`../notebooks/1-preprocessing_notebook_v2`
   Complete data preprocessing workflow with quality control steps.

:doc:`../notebooks/2-training_notebook`
   Model training and optimization techniques.

Analysis and Visualization
--------------------------

:doc:`../notebooks/3-velocity_umaps_notebook`
   Velocity analysis and UMAP visualization techniques.

:doc:`../notebooks/4-map_velocity_notebook`
   Map velocities between gene and gene program spaces.

:doc:`../notebooks/5-plotting_notebook`
   Create publication-ready plots and visualizations.

Advanced Topics
----------------

:doc:`../notebooks/6-perturbation_notebook`
   Study the sensitivity of velocity predictions to expression changes.

:doc:`../notebooks/7-uncertainty_notebook`
   Uncertainty quantification in velocity predictions.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before starting the tutorials, make sure you have:

1. LineageVI installed (see :doc:`../installation`)
2. Basic knowledge of Python and single-cell analysis
3. Familiarity with scanpy and AnnData objects

Each tutorial builds on the previous ones, so we recommend going through them in order.
