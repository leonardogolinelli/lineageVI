Basic Tutorials
---------------

:doc:`preprocessing`
   Data preprocessing and quality control for LineageVI analysis.

:doc:`basic_usage`
   Learn the fundamentals of LineageVI with a simple example.

:doc:`../../notebooks/1-preprocessing_notebook_v2`
   Complete preprocessing workflow with executed outputs.

:doc:`../../notebooks/2-training_notebook`
   Model training and optimization techniques.

Advanced Topics
---------------

:doc:`../../notebooks/3-velocity_umaps_notebook`
   Velocity analysis and UMAP visualization.

:doc:`../../notebooks/4-uncertainty_notebook`
   Uncertainty quantification in velocity predictions.

:doc:`../../notebooks/5-plotting_notebook`
   Create publication-ready plots and visualizations.

:doc:`../../notebooks/6-perturbation_notebook`
   Study the sensitivity of velocity predictions to expression changes.

:doc:`../../notebooks/7-map_velocity_notebook`
   Map velocities between gene and gene program spaces.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before starting the tutorials, make sure you have:

1. LineageVI installed (see :doc:`../installation`)
2. Basic knowledge of Python and single-cell analysis
3. Familiarity with scanpy and AnnData objects

Each tutorial builds on the previous ones, so we recommend going through them in order.
